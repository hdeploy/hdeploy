TODO:

- create / adapt chef recipes for HDeploy (client and server)




Building a test environment

1/ install MySQL database
2/ have some kind of code to deploy
3/ have some kind of config for the code (chef?)
   >> installs daemon
   >>
4/ install and run API
5/ 

make it ready for demo: add some special exceptions for the deploy to self (don't use fab?)
add options for not using sudo
add options for using bundler on remote server
